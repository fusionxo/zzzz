            <h2>Our Story: The Need for Clarity</h2>
            <p>Calverse was born out of a simple, personal need. While navigating our own health journeys, we realized there was a glaring gap in the digital wellness space for Indians. Most available solutions were either too expensive, lacked a credible Indian food database, or had confusing interfaces that didn't work well on mobile devices. Some apps treated all food simplistically. If it had protein, it was “good.” But nutrition is far more nuanced, and that’s where we knew we could do better.</p>
            <p>As a small but passionate team of developers and designers, we decided to build Calverse, an intuitive health platform that speaks your language, respects your local diet, and empowers you with clarity instead of confusion.</p>

            <h2>Why We Built Calverse: The Problems We Solve</h2>
            <p>We saw three major challenges preventing people from making informed health decisions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Poor Label Literacy:</strong> People often misinterpret complex food labels, assuming anything marketed as "healthy" or "high-protein" is good for them without understanding the full picture.</li>
                <li><strong>Overpriced & Irrelevant Apps:</strong> Most popular health apps are designed for Western audiences, using non-Indian food data and hiding essential features behind expensive paywalls.</li>
                <li><strong>Confusing User Experience:</strong> Many apps are difficult to navigate, overwhelming users with data but offering little practical insight, especially for those who need speed and clarity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We decided to fix all three, and more.</p>

            <h2>Our Solution: Your Personal Health Dashboard</h2>
            <p>Calverse is not just another food logging app. It’s your personal health command center, built from the ground up with Indian users and dietary needs in mind. Here's what makes us different:</p>
