            <p>Thank you for choosing Calverse. This Payments and Refund Policy outlines how we process payments, handle taxes, issue refunds, and more to ensure a transparent and secure experience for our users.</p>
            
            <h2>1. Accepted Payment Methods</h2>
            <p>All transactions on our platform are securely processed via <strong>Razorpay</strong>, a trusted and PCI-DSS-compliant payment gateway. We accept the following methods of payment, processed in <strong>Indian Rupees (INR)</strong> only:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>üí≥ Credit / Debit Cards:</strong> Visa, Mastercard, American Express, RuPay.</li>
                <li><strong>üì± Digital Wallets:</strong> PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm.</li>
                <li><strong>üè¶ Net Banking / Bank Transfers:</strong> NEFT, RTGS, IMPS.</li>
                <li><strong>üîó Unified Payments Interface (UPI):</strong> All major UPI apps supported via Razorpay.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Payment Security</h2>
            <p>Your payment security is our top priority. We employ multiple layers of security to protect your sensitive information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>We use industry-standard <strong>SSL (Secure Socket Layer) encryption</strong> to protect your data during transmission.</li>
                <li>All payments are processed directly through Razorpay's secure environment. <strong>We do not store any credit/debit card information on our servers.</strong></li>
                <li>Razorpay complies with the highest level of PCI DSS standards, ensuring a safe and secure transaction experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>3. Pricing & Billing</h2>
            <p>We believe in transparent pricing. All prices displayed on our platform are inclusive of applicable taxes (currently <strong>18% GST</strong>) unless explicitly stated otherwise. Each plan is a one-time, prepaid purchase. We do not offer automatic subscriptions, so you will never be charged automatically for a renewal. An official invoice and receipt are issued immediately upon successful payment and sent to your registered email address.</p>

            <h2>4. Detailed Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>We strive to maintain fairness and transparency in all transactions. Please read our refund policy carefully before making a purchase, as our digital services are accessible immediately upon payment.</p>
            
            <h3>Refund Eligibility & Conditions</h3>
            <p>To be eligible for a refund, your request must meet the criteria outlined for your specific plan and must be accompanied by a <strong>clear and valid reason</strong>. Valid reasons may include technical issues on our platform preventing service use or billing errors. Refunds will not be issued for reasons of non-usage or change of mind.</p>

            <h3>Plan-wise Refund Breakdown</h3>

            <h4>üîπ Starter Plan ‚Äì ‚Çπ99 / 1 Month</h4>
            <p>This introductory plan is <strong>strictly non-refundable</strong> under any circumstances. Once purchased, no partial or full refund will be processed.</p>

            <h4>üî∏ Growth Plan ‚Äì ‚Çπ269 / 3 Months</h4>
            <p>Refunds for the Growth Plan are eligible only within the active subscription period, with deductions for the months already completed. The deduction is calculated at the rate of the Starter Plan (‚Çπ99 + 18% GST) for each completed month.</p>
